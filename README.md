### What is MachineLiker?
[**MachineLiker**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/MachineLiker) is a script that can be run using the Termux application and functions to get lots of spam likes on Facebook posts.

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) application to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/MachineLiker
$ cd "MachineLiker"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/MachineLiker" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### What is the limit for sending likes?
Each fake Facebook account can send as many as 10 likes in one day. You can use another account to send likes continuously.

### When will likes arrive on posts?
Likes will increase every minute or even hour according to the number of script users. To overcome unwanted likes, read below!
**Solution:**
- The post is not public or the post link is incorrect.
- Posts do not have a like button.
- You don't get post link in Native Facebook App.
- There was a problem with https://machine-likers.com/.

### Requirements for logging in?

- Fake Facebook accounts have at least 1 post, a profile photo, and a cover photo.
- Use new account or fake account to login.
- After you have finished using the script, you should be required to change the password for your fake Facebook account.
- Facebook accounts have several friends so that spam is not detected.

### Why does login fail?

- Please change the fake Facebook account password then log in again.
- Your Facebook account uses two-factor authentication.
- The username or password you entered is incorrect.
- You can use another account to log in.
- Your IP address was spammed when logging in to the Facebook API.
- You must use airplane mode before logging in.

### Lost Facebook account?

- Don't use your original or main Facebook account, instead use a fake or new account.
- Facebook can block your password so you need to reset the password.
- Change the password after accessing this script to avoid related accounts on the website.

### Why is my account blocked?

- Because these services like each other, the possibility of being blocked is very possible.
- Maybe because Facebook has detected that your account is a fake or spam account.
- Fake Facebook account has been detected as spam, you should complete it with a telephone number and email.
- Because this login uses the Facebook API, the possibility of being blocked is very large.

### Why do likes drop?

- The post has been detected as spam so Facebook deletes spam likes on your post.
- They unlike your posts.
- Accounts that like your posts are blocked or disabled.

### Post link requirements?
- Retrieving post links must be via the original Facebook application.
- Posts must have a like button or be public.
- Before entering the post link into Termux, make sure you visit the post via browser.

### How long will it take me to get the next like?
You can wait 30 minutes to 1 hour to get the next like or you can exceed the time limit if the website is having problems.
